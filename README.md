# mdyehouseWinterProject

This project attempts to use HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors in conjunction with NU32 boards using PIC32 microcontrollers and XBee radio tranceivers in a sensor network for localization of a mobile robot. The goal is to allow the mobile robot to navigate a simple space in limited sensor circumstances.
