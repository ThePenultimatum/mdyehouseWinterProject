Jan 22-29:
Hook up ultrasonic sensor to 1 microcontroller or RPi
Data exploration
Data collection
Test quality, range of ultrasonic sensor

Jan 29 - Feb 5:
Read sensor data
Get xbee's working (ideally two xbee's talking to each other)
Read data from PIC32 to computer

Feb 5-12:
Add 2nd and 3rd nodes, same setup as first
Get them to communicate measured data with xbee's

Feb 12-19:
Tests with static objects
Tune and adjust system

Feb 19-26:
Add a mobile robot at a static location and be able to get data to and from it via xbee

Feb 26 - March 5:
Mobile robot reacts to data
It either follows a command over radio from xbee's or aggregates info from the sensor network and acts on it to minimize some metric by testing its reaction to movements in different directions (similar to gradient descent)

March 5-12:
Robot moves to a goal location

March 12-19:
Tuning
Next steps
Docs
Licenses
Up the complexity
More sensors, nodes, etc.
